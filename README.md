# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This is a Final Year Academic Project that focuses on detecting **fake news** using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The system includes a web interface built using Django and Bootstrap, and supports both model training and testing on sample news content.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Fake news has become a major problem in today's digital world. This project builds a system that can automatically classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using multiple machine learning classifiers.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Detect fake news using trained ML models
- NLP-based preprocessing of news content
- User interface for inputting and classifying news text
- Real-world datasets for training and testing
- Built with Django framework and Bootstrap UI
- Codebase organized for both backend (ML + Django) and frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

- Count Vectorizer (Bag of Words)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- Django
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML / CSS / Bootstrap
- SQLite (for temporary storage)
